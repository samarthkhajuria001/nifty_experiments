## Key Observations

1.  **Trend Confirmation is Stronger in Bear Markets:**
    *   In a **Bear Trend**, seeing 2 Bear bars (35.73%) is nearly **3x more likely** than seeing 2 Bull bars (12.69%).
    *   In a **Bull Trend**, the bias is positive but less extreme (29.33% vs 21.41%).

2.  **"Opposite" is the Default:**
    *   Regardless of the trend, ~50% of days start with mixed signals in the first hour. This suggests that patience (waiting for the 1-hour range breakout) is often warranted.

3.  **Rare Events:**
    *   **2 Bull Bars in a Bear Trend** happens only ~12% of the time. If this occurs, it is a significant deviation from the norm and warrants close attention for a potential trend change or a "trap" setup.
